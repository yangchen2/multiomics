# Knight Lab Multi-omics Resources

This repository has been created to provide resources on performing microbiome multi-omics analyses for the Knight Lab.

1) Functional QIIME2 environments for [mmvec](https://github.com/biocore/mmvec) and [joint-rpca](https://github.com/biocore/gemelli) and how to install them on Barnacle2.
2) Coming soon: Additional tutorials, example scripts/notebooks, and resources for mmvec and joint-rpca analyses.


This repository has been adapted from [https://github.com/ahdilmore/multiomics](https://github.com/ahdilmore/multiomics).
